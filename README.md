## Cloning repository on your local machine**

**To Beginners

When a software is in a remote repository (roughly a folder on internet), developers need to make a copy of the files (or clone) into the local machine (your PC).

To do so, one first have to have GIT installed on your computer. A brief tutorial may be find in [here](http://robotica.ufscar.br/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=software:git).

There are a few other softwares that manage GIT repositories in your local machine. Use the one you are most comfortable with.

Use these steps to clone  If you prefer to clone from the command line, see 

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
